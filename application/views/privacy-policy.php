                <p>Welcome to the Talrn website (“Site”). SuperLabs (“Talrn”, “we”, “us”, and/or “our”) operates this Site to provide our users (“you” and “your”) with information about Talrn and its platform.
“Talrn is used by professional freelancers (“Freelancers”) who wish to offer their development, engineering and other services (“Services”) and clients who need the Services (“Clients”). Freelancers that have passed our screening process and are admitted to our network of professional Freelancers (“Network”) are referred to as “Talent”. For purposes of this policy the term “Freelancers” is broader in scope and includes both Talent and Freelancers who are not Talent. The Personal Data we receive from Freelancers and Clients and how we handle it differs, so we explain our data practices for Freelancers and Clients in two distinct sections below.

				<h4 class="mb-3">A. Information That You Provide To Us</h4>
                <p>When you apply as a Freelancer on the Site, you are asking to be admitted to our Network. In order to admit you to the Network and match your qualifications with our Client’s needs, we need to perform a screening process, which evaluates your language skills, personality, domain-specific knowledge, competence and professionalism. We may also need to screen potential Freelancers for specific technical skills, as required by our Clients. In this context, you will be asked to provide information about yourself, which includes:</p>
				 <ul class="icon-list bullet-bg bullet-soft-primary">

                </ul>
				<h4 class="mb-3">Verifying Your Identity and Biometric Data</h4>
				<p>If you are asking to be admitted to our Network, with your explicit written informed consent (which you may provide at the time of submitting a request to be admitted) we may collect biometric information about you to verify and confirm your identity and as further described below. We may ask you to take a photo of yourself and of your government-issued identification through your mobile phone (the “Verification Data”). The Verification Data will be provided to our biometric technology service provider, who will use facial recognition technology to analyze the geometry of your face through the photographs and extract biometric information or biometric identifiers relating to you (collectively, “Biometric Data”). The Verification Data and the Biometric Data will be used to verify and confirm your identity. However, Talrn will not receive the Biometric Data but will only receive scores that will indicate the authenticity of the government-issued identification, whether your identity has been verified and confirmed, and your name from your government-issued identification. Once the scores are returned to Talrn, will not retain and will permanently delete the Biometric Data.</p>
			    <p>Moreover, third party verifiers will use the Verification Data to improve the accuracy, reliability, usability, and functionality of its identity verification technology, for fraud prevention and incident investigation efforts; for such purposes, Third Party Verifiers  will retain your Verification Data for up to 180 days, after which the Verification Data will be permanently deleted. Talrn will retain your self-photo and your name for fraud prevention purposes based upon our legitimate interests. </p>
			    <p>Consenting to the collection and processing of your Biometric Data and your Verification Data as described in this Privacy Policy is voluntary and if you do not consent to the collection of your Biometric Data and Verification Data, we will allow you to provide us your government-issued identification and confirm your identity via video conference, and may ask you to provide us with a photo of yourself. Talrn will retain your self-photo and your name for fraud prevention purposes based upon our legitimate interests. If you consented to the collection of your Biometric Data and Verification Data, but later change your mind, you have the right to withdraw your consent by contacting us at privacy@talrn.com . If you withdraw your consent, we will apply your preferences going forward and this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing of your Biometric Data or Verification Data prior to the effective date of your consent withdrawal. Your Biometric Data and Verification Data may be shared with third-party service providers who provide support services with respect to the biometric technology implemented by, and services provided by, Third Party Verifiers . For more information on how Third Party Verifiers  may handle your Verification Data and Biometric Data, please review Third Party Verifiers ’s website and privacy policy. Moreover, your photo and name may be shared with third-party service providers who assist us with our IT, security, and fraud programs, our professional advisors, and as required by law or regulation.</p>
			    <h4 class="mb-3">Background Check </h4>
				<p>Our provider of background check services may collect additional data about you (including information about criminal convictions or offences) if and when we undertake vetting/background checks. If applicable to you, your consent to the collection of such additional data will be solicited at such time, pursuant to applicable laws.</p>
				<h4 class="mb-3">Information You Share</h4>
